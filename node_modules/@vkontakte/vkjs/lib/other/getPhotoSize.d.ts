/**
 * Searches for the smallest (?) suitable image from the sizes array.
 *
 * Or more precise, it returns:
 *   – if no suitable sizes (>= minWidth И >= minHeight): the biggest from all sizes;
 *   – there are any suitable (>= minWidth И >= minHeight): the smallest of the matching sizes;
 *
 * Returns null only in case of an empty/invalid array. The returned size can be smaller than minWidth or minHeight.
 *
 * The function doesn't take into about the retina screen (window.devicePixelRatio), so you have to calculate the right width/height from the outside to support it.
 *
 * WARN:
 * - does not reckon for letter-sizes (PhotosPhotoSizesType).
 * - does not know how to search for the "nearest" size, or the maximum image (there is a hack with the `Infinity` pass).
 *
 * @example
 *   getPhotoSize([{ width: 1, height: 1 }, { width: 3, height: 3 }], 1) // => 1,1
 *   getPhotoSize([{ width: 1, height: 1 }, { width: 3, height: 3 }], 2) // => 3,3
 *   getPhotoSize([{ width: 1, height: 1 }, { width: 3, height: 3 }], 4) // => 3,3
 *
 * See more examples in tests
